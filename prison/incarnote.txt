Using the incareration rate (based on the slope of the data) during the Reagan administration 
as a baseline, the rate increased over 1 and one-half times under George Bush, with the greatest
increase during Clinton's term, at almost 1.7 times that of Reagan. The rate declines under 
George W. Bush, with the slope going negative under Obama.
